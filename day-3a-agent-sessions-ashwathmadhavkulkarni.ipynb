This is a crucial step in the process, as finding the right biological target is the foundation for developing an effective drug.\n\nHere's a deeper dive into what this development entails:\n\n**What is a Biological Target?**\n\nIn simple terms, a biological target is a molecule within the body that a drug is designed to interact with. Most often, these targets are proteins (like enzymes, receptors, or ion channels) that play a critical role in a disease process. By modulating the activity of this target – either inhibiting it, activating it, or changing its function – a drug can help treat the disease.\n\n**How AI Improves Target Identification and Validation:**\n\nTraditionally, identifying and validating targets has been a painstaking, often serendipitous, and lengthy process involving extensive laboratory experiments and hypothesis-driven research. AI is revolutionizing this by:\n\n1.  **Analyzing Massive, Multi-Omics Datasets:**\n    *   **Genomics:** AI can process entire human genomes and identify genetic variations (mutations) that are associated with specific diseases. It can help understand which genes are \"upregulated\" or \"downregulated\" in diseased states.\n    *   **Proteomics:** AI can analyze the abundance and modifications of proteins within cells or tissues. This helps identify proteins that are present in abnormal amounts or forms in disease.\n    *   **Transcriptomics:** This involves studying RNA molecules, which are involved in gene expression. AI can analyze transcriptomic data to understand which genes are being actively transcribed into proteins.\n    *   **Metabolomics:** AI can analyze the small molecules (metabolites) involved in cellular processes, providing insights into metabolic pathways that are dysregulated in disease.\n    *   **Clinical Data:** AI can also integrate anonymized patient data (medical history, symptoms, treatment responses) to identify correlations between biological factors and disease outcomes.\n\n2.  **Uncovering Complex Biological Pathways and Networks:**\n    *   Diseases are rarely caused by a single faulty molecule. They often involve intricate networks of interacting proteins and pathways.\n    *   AI algorithms, particularly **graph neural networks** and **machine learning models**, can map these complex relationships. They can identify \"bottlenecks\" or critical nodes within these pathways that, if targeted, could have a significant therapeutic effect.\n    *   This allows researchers to move beyond studying individual molecules in isolation to understanding the system-level disruptions caused by disease.\n\n3.  **Predicting Causality vs. Correlation:**\n    *   A major challenge in biology is distinguishing between a biological factor that *causes* a disease and one that is merely *associated* with it (correlation). A drug targeting a correlated factor might have no therapeutic benefit.\n    *   AI models are being developed to infer causal relationships from observational data, helping researchers prioritize targets that are more likely to be causal drivers of disease.\n\n4.  **Validating Targets More Efficiently:**\n    *   Once a potential target is identified, it needs to be validated – meaning, experimental evidence must confirm its role in the disease.\n    *   AI can assist in this by:\n        *   **Suggesting relevant experiments:** Based on the data, AI can recommend specific laboratory experiments to test the target's function.\n        *   **Analyzing experimental results:** AI can help interpret the outcomes of these experiments, even from high-throughput screening.\n        *   **Predicting off-target effects:** AI can analyze the structure of a potential target and predict whether interacting with it might lead to unintended side effects by affecting other proteins.\n\n**Benefits of AI-Powered Target Identification and Validation:**\n\n*   **Speed:** Significantly reduces the time it takes to identify promising targets compared to traditional methods.\n*   **Novelty:** Uncovers targets that might have been missed by human researchers due to the sheer complexity of the data.\n*   **Accuracy:** Increases the likelihood of selecting targets that are truly relevant to the disease, leading to higher success rates in subsequent drug development.\n*   **Cost-Effectiveness:** By focusing R&D efforts on more promising targets, AI can help reduce the overall cost of drug discovery.\n\n**Examples in Action:**\n\n*   **Identifying novel oncology targets:** AI can analyze tumor genomics and patient data to find mutations in specific pathways that are driving cancer growth, pointing to new drug targets.\n*   **Understanding neurodegenerative diseases:** By analyzing brain imaging and genetic data, AI can help identify protein aggregates or signaling pathways that are involved in diseases like Alzheimer's, suggesting new therapeutic avenues.\n\nIn essence, AI acts like a super-powered detective, sifting through vast oceans of biological information to find the most promising \"suspects\" (targets) that, when acted upon by a drug, can bring about therapeutic change. This makes the early stages of drug discovery much more informed and efficient.\n\n ### Session: compaction_demo\n\nUser > Who are the main companies involved in that?\ngemini-2.5-flash-lite >  Several types of companies are deeply involved in leveraging AI for target identification and validation in drug discovery.

Once the threshold was met, it triggered the summarization process in the background.\n3.  **Verified Result**: By inspecting the session's events, you found the summary that the LLM generated. This summary now replaces the older, more verbose turns in the agent's active context.\n\n**For all future turns in this conversation, the agent will be given this concise summary instead of the full history.** This saves costs, improves performance, and helps the agent stay focused on what's most important.\n","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"### 4.5 More Context Engineering options in ADK\n\n#### 👉 Custom Compaction\nIn this example, we used ADK's default summarizer.

This allows you to control the summarization prompt or even use a different, specialized LLM for the task. You can read more about it in the [official documentation](https://google.github.io/adk-docs/context/compaction/).\n\n#### 👉 Context Caching\nADK also provides **Context Caching** to help reduce the token size of the static instructions that are fed to the LLM by caching the request data.

But real conversations involve hundreds of such characteristics:\n- User preferences and habits\n- Past interactions and their outcomes\n- Domain knowledge and expertise levels\n- Communication styles and patterns\n- Contextual relationships between topics\n\n**The Memory System in ADK automates this entire process**, making it a valuable asset for building truly Context-Aware Agents that can accommodate any user's current and future needs.\n\nIn the next notebook (Part 2: Memory Management), you'll learn how to:\n- Enable automatic memory extraction from conversations\n- Build agents that learn and adapt over time\n- Create truly personalized experiences at scale\n- Manage long-term knowledge across sessions\n\nReady to transform your manual state management into an intelligent, automated Memory system?
